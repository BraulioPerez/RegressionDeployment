## Project Name: California House Price Prediction

### Project Overview
This project implements a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices in California based on a variety of features, including geographical coordinates, distance from the coast, area, and other variables. The model uses a dataset with these features to predict the house price through multiple regression analysis.

### Features
- Predict house prices based on multiple variables (coordinates, area, distance to coast, etc.)
- User-friendly web interface for inputting house data and receiving predictions

### Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python (for modeling), HTML, CSS (for the GUI)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks (for building the model), Docker (for deployment)

### Installation Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to build and start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Once the container is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application's interface.

### Usage Instructions
1. Open the GUI through your browser.
2. Input the details of your house (e.g., coordinates, area, distance from the coast, etc.).
3. Submit the data to get a predicted house price based on the linear regression model.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
